COMMANDS                                                       *picker-commands*

vim-picker provides the following commands:

                                                            *picker-:PickerEdit*
:PickerEdit [directory]    Pick a file to edit in the current window. This
                           takes a optional argument, which is the directory in
                           which to run the file listing tool. If not specified,
                           this defaults to the current working directory.

                                                           *picker-:PickerSplit*
:PickerSplit [directory]   Pick a file to edit in a new horizontal split. This
                           takes an optional directory argument in the same
                           manner as |:PickerEdit|.

                                                         *picker-:PickerTabedit*
:PickerTabedit [directory] Pick a file to edit in a new tab. This takes an
                           optional directory argument in the same manner as

                                                          *picker-:PickerVsplit*
:PickerVsplit [directory]  Pick a file to edit in a new vertical split. This
                           takes an optional directory argument in the same
                           manner as |:PickerEdit|.

                                                          *picker-:PickerBuffer*
:PickerBuffer              Pick a buffer to edit in the curent window.

                                                             *picker-:PickerTag*

:PickerStag                Pick a tag to jump to in a new horizontal split.

                                                       *picker-:PickerBufferTag*
:PickerBufferTag           Pick a tag from the current buffer to jump to.

                                                            *picker-:PickerHelp*
:PickerHelp                Pick a help tag to jump to in the current window.

                                                *picker-:PickerListUserCommands*

MAPPINGS                                                       *picker-mappings*

vim-picker provides the following |<Plug>| mappings:

<Plug>(PickerEdit)                  Execute :PickerEdit
<Plug>(PickerSplit)                 Execute :PickerSplit
<Plug>(PickerTabedit)               Execute :PickerTabedit
<Plug>(PickerVsplit)                Execute :PickerVsplit
<Plug>(PickerBuffer)                Execute :PickerBuffer
<Plug>(PickerTag)                   Execute :PickerTag
<Plug>(PickerStag)                  Execute :PickerStag
<Plug>(PickerBufferTag)             Execute :PickerBufferTag
<Plug>(PickerHelp)                  Execute :PickerHelp
<Plug>(PickerListUserCommands)      Execute :PickerListUserCommands

The above mappings replace previous mappings that lacked the parentheses to
fix an issue whereby Vim would pause before executing a mapping if its name
was a prefix of another mapping. The old mappings without parentheses are
deprecated, but remain present for backward compatibility.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                             *picker-configuration*

By default, vim-picker uses Git to list files inside Git repositories. In
directories which are not inside a Git repository, vim-picker will use `fd`
(https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) to list files, falling back to `find` if `fd`
is not available.

To use an alternative method of listing files, for example because you want to
customise the flags passed to Git, because you use a different version control
system, or because you want to use an alternative to `fd` or `find`, a custom
file listing tool can be used.

To use a custom file listing tool, set `g:picker_custom_find_executable` and
`g:picker_custom_find_flags` in your |vimrc|. For example, to use ripgrep
(https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) set:
>
    let g:picker_custom_find_executable = 'rg'
    let g:picker_custom_find_flags = '--color never --files'
<
If `g:picker_custom_find_executable` is set, and the executable it references
is found, it will always be used in place of Git, `fd`, or `find`. Therefore
you may want to make `g:picker_custom_find_executable` a wrapper script that
implements your own checks and fallbacks: for example using `hg` in Mercurial
repositories, `ripgrep` elsewhere, and falling back to `find` if `ripgrep` is
not installed.

By default vim-picker will use `fzy` (https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) as the
fuzzy selector. You can change this by setting `g:picker_selector_executable`
and `g:picker_selector_flags` in your |vimrc|. For example, to use `pick`
(https://github.com/mptre/pick) set:
>
    let g:picker_selector_executable = 'pick'
    let g:picker_selector_flags = ''
<
By default, vim-picker will run the fuzzy selector in a full width split at
the bottom of the window, using |:botright|. You can change this by setting
`g:picker_split` in your |vimrc|. For example, to open a full width split at
the top of the window, set:
>
    let g:picker_split = 'topleft'
<
See |opening-window| for other valid values.

To specify the height of the window in which the fuzzy selector is opened, set
`g:picker_height` in your |vimrc|. The default is 10 lines:
>
    let g:picker_height = 10
<

FUNCTIONS                                                     *picker-functions*

                                                              *picker#Execute()*
picker#Execute({id})
    Execute the fuzzy selector using the user-defined command with the given
    identifier.

                                                             *picker#Register()*
picker#Register({id}, {selection_type}, {vim_command}, {shell_command})
    Register a new user-defined command.

    When activated with |picker#Execute()|, the output of the shell command
    will be piped into the fuzzy selector, the line selected by the user will
    be processed according to {selection_type}, and the processed line will
    finally be passed as a single argument to {vim_command}.

    {id} is a string specifying a unique name used to identify the
    user-defined command with |picker#Execute()|.

    {selection_type} is a string equal to either 'string' or 'file'. 'string'
    selections are passed unchanged as a single argument to {vim_command}.
    'file' selections are treated as filenames: spaces and special characters
    are escaped before executing {vim_command}.

    {vim_command} is a string specifying the Vim command which will be called
    with the user's selection as a single argument.

    {shell_command} is a string specifying a shell command consisting of
    either a single command or a series of piped commands that will generate a
    newline separated list of candidates to be piped to the fuzzy selector.
